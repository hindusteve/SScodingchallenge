Javascript solutions to two coding challenges.

For SolutionStreet1 - coding challenge is for a given string input, return a string with any duplicate character removed.
Ex. if given "tree traversal", return "tre avsl"

For SolutionStreet2 - coding challeng is for a given string input, identify which is the non-repeating character.
Ex. if given "AABBCCDEE", return "D"

2nd commit on 05/15 refactored SolutionStreet1, streamlined coding by referring to array element directly rather than storing it in a variable, and implemented use of prompt method to accept user input, rather than pre-populating the input variable.
